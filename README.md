This is my submission for the final project of phy328 Advanced Programming in Python.


neural_network.py contains my neural network module and tests. some of the test were orriginally written by my professor.
I copy and pasted them, then modified them slightly to fit my code.


solutions.ipynb contains the training iterations for the neural network. I hate jupyter notebooks as much as any other rational person, but we were required to use them.


I wish I could also share the problem statement and dataset, but those arent mine to share.
