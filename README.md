This is my submission for the final project of phy328 Advanced Programming in Python.


neural_network.py contains my neural network module and tests.
some of the tests were originally written by my professor.
With his permission, I copy and pasted them, then modified them slightly to fit my code.


solutions.ipynb contains preprocessing and the training iterations for the neural network.
I hate jupyter notebooks as much as any other rational person, but we were required to use them.


I wish I could also share the problem statement and dataset, but those aren't mine to share.
